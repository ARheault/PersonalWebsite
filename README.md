# My Personal Website

My personal website's source code is available here. It is a portfolio website that uses basic html, css, 
and javascript that is deployed and served from a node.js server running in a droplet from digital ocean.

To run this code locally, follow the following steps.


To run this code it will be assumed that you have node and npm (node package manager) installed. If you do not I recommend [this guide for windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows) as well as [this guide for mac](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html) as it is an easy way to get set up and finally [this guide for linux users](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/).
