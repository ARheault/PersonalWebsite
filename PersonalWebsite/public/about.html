                    My name is Alex Rheault and I am a .Net Developer for Graphic Products. I live in Portland Oregon now, but I was raised in Clayton California. I am passionate about Computer Science and I want to continue to learn new and exciting technologies everyday.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                Working as a bartender teaches one to be self reliant while keeping up with the needs of a team. That has translated very well into personal, and academic, projects of mine.
                I have full stack experience working with the MERN development stack as well as systems and operating systems programming experience, where I modified MIT's xv6 operating system.
                The modifications included optimizations such as building new process selection algorithms that resulted in significantly increased efficiency. Working as a full stack development
                intern taught me how to work intimately with a team while managing timelines. Using modern development stacks is an exciting and powerful part of my job. Fundamentals are always a
                focus of mine, however, as I help undergraduate students at Portland State University work through foundational concepts as a computer science tutor.
                I am continuing my journey in software development as a .Net Developer for Graphic Products, a company local to Portland, Oregon. My career in industry has only just begin, but I look
                forward to growing in the field that I am so passionate about.
